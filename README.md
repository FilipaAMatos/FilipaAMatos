- 👋 Hi, I’m @FilipaAMatos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL and Ruby
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any project or company that can help me to grow and develop my IT skills
- I am trying to start a new career in the IT field, so if anyone has any suggestions for projects for beginners (or maybe suggestions for new languages or tools that I should learn next) they will be most welcomed
