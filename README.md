- 👋 Hi, I’m @FilipaAMatos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL and Ruby
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project or work with a company that can help me grow and develop my IT skills
- ✨ I am trying to start a new career in the IT field, so if anyone has any suggestions of projects for beginners (or suggestions of new languages and tools that I should learn next) they would be most welcomed
